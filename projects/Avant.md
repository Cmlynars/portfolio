I lead all design projects at a fintech company focused on improving the online borrowing experience for middle-income consumers.<br><br>

The scope of work includes all web experiences for two financial products, iOS and Android mobile applications, user research initiatives, usability testing, email creation, and some front-end development responsibilities.<br><br>

My team has designed multiple, 100 plus screen experiences including product dashboards and application processes. <br><br>

I am also responsible for rolling out a completely new, modern brand across all products and communications channels.
