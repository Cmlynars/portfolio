Designed a series of conceptual, over-ear headphones to convey and encourage the intentions of the wearer, specifically: intimacy, attention, isolation.<br><br>

Headphones are used for more than just listening to audio recordings. By designing for the additional uses of over-ear headphones, the form proposes new relationships between the object and the wearer.
