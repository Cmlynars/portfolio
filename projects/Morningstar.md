<p>I worked as a UX Designer on Morningstar's 401(k) robo-advisor product, Retirement Manager.</p>

<p>I conducted all aspects of the usability testing process including script writing, participant sourcing, and building interactive prototypes using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>

<p>I provided sketched and high-fidelity wireframes to simplify complex financial information and user interactions.</p>

<p>By collaborating with the behavioral insights team, we improved the product's choice architecture, reduced decision fatigue, and A/B tested labor illusion concepts to improve the user experience.</p>

<p>Because my work was concentrated on the UX, I have not included visual design mockups of the interface.</p>
