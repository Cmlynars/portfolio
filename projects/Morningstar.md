I worked as a UX Designer on Morningstar's 401(k) robo-advisor product, Retirement Manager.<br><br>

I conducted all aspects of the usability testing process including script writing, participant sourcing, and building interactive prototypes using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.<br><br>

I provided sketched and high-fidelity wireframes with a team of other designers and content strategists to simplify complex financial information and user interactions.<br><br>

By collaborating with the behavioral insights team, we improved the product's choice architecture, reduced decision fatigue, and A/B tested labor illusion concepts to improve the product experience.<br><br>
