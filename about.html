		<h3>About</h3>
		<p>After graduating from Georgetown Univesity with a major in Chinese language, I served as a Princeton in Asia fellow based in China.</p>

		<p>I served as both an English teacher at a university in Wuhan and a project manager for <a class="inline-link" href="{{ site.baseurl}}/projects/planet_finance_china.html" target="_blank">PlaNet Finance China</a>, the China branch of an international microfinance consultancy based in Beijing. It was during my time designing financial education tools at Planet Finance that I was first exposed to the design processes, and its ability to solve problems beyond the aesthetic.</p>

		<p>After returning from China, I continued my study of design, which led me first to a UX design position at <a class="inline-link" href="{{ site.baseurl}}/projects/morningstar.html" target="_blank">Morningstar</a> and to eventually heading up the design department at <a class="inline-link" href="{{ site.baseurl}}/projects/avant.html" target="_blank">Avant</a>.</p>

		<p>I'm interested in bringing the human-centered design process to industries not traditionally affiliated with design. I also believe strongly in the power of <a class="inline-link" href="{{ site.baseurl}}/projects/listening_devices.html" target="_blank">conceptual design</a> to create experiences and objects that question convention.</p>

		<p>For anything design related, please feel free to contact me via <a class="inline-link" href="{{ site.baseurl}}/projects/listening_devices.html" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>.</p>
