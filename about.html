		<h3>About</h3>
		<p>
			I graduated from Georgetown University in 2012 with a major in Chinese and a minor in business. Determined to justify my tuition expense and time spent studying Chinese, I applied to a China-based post as a Princeton in Asia fellow after graduation. <br><br>
			
			During my first year, I served as an English teacher at a university in Wuhan, China. My second post was working at <a class="inline-link" href="{{ site.baseurl}}/projects/planet_finance_china.html" target="_blank">PlaNet Finance China</a>, an international microfinance consultancy. It was during my time there that I was first exposed to the design processes, and its ability to solve problems beyond the aesthetic.
			<br><br>
			After returning from China, I continued my study of design by taking classes at General Assembly in D.C. and the School of the Art Institute in Chicago. This led me to a UX design position at <a class="inline-link" href="{{ site.baseurl}}/projects/morningstar.html" target="_blank">Morningstar</a> and to eventually heading up the design department at <a class="inline-link" href="{{ site.baseurl}}/projects/avant.html" target="_blank">Avant</a>.
			<br><br>
			I'm interested in bringing the human-centered design process to industries not traditionally affiliated with design. I also believe strongly in the power of <a class="inline-link" href="{{ site.baseurl}}/projects/listening_devices.html" target="_blank">conceptual design</a> to create experiences and objects that question convention.</p>
